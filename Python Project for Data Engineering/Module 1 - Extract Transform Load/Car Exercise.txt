Complete the following practice exercises:

Create a folder data_source and use the terminal shell to change the current directory to \home\project\data_source. Create a file etl_practice.py in this folder.

Download and unzip the data available in the link shared above.

The data available has four headers: 'car_model', 'year_of_manufacture', 'price', 'fuel'. Implement the extraction process for the CSV, JSON, and XML files.

Transform the values under the 'price' header such that they are rounded to 2 decimal places.

Implement the loading function for the transformed data to a target file, transformed_data.csv.

Implement the logging function for the entire process and save it in log_file.txt.

Test the implemented functions and log the events as done in the lab.
